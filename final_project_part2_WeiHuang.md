# Final Project
## Part2
#### Collecting Data
> The data for cancer is easy to collect because it has been researched for so many years. However, different datasets have their schema. Some focus on the duration of the years some just focus on a year. Before using the datasets to prove my store, first I need to clean the data and pick out what kinds of data I would like to use in my store.

#### Visualization
> At first, I used Tableau as the tool to make the visualization. However, I found out Tableau has lots of functions and can customerlize too much, which took me so much time to create a visualization. But Flourish provides the defual setting for each type of visualization. With Flourish, I only need to adjust a little for each visualization, which saves me a lot of time. Moreover, the graph created by Fourish can easily merge with Shorthand. 

#### Research protocol
> 1. The target audience you hope to reach with your story
> - Adults in age between 25 to 60. Let them be aware that cancer is not only about the genatic, but also about the environment.
> 2. Your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
> - People who are in the age range and have some experience in making a public presentation.
> 3. Interview script
> - How do you think the outline of the story? 
> - At the first glance what attract you?
> - What is the main idea do you see in each visualization?
> - What kinds of modification can make the visualization more clear?
> 4. Findings
> - Critique 1:
>> Overall the story is attractive because of the animation, interaction, and cute visualization. However, there are still some places that can be improved. 
>> 1. The change for the line chart is not clear. And to use the percentage number, using % is better than decimal.
>> 2. For the bar chart, the legend can place close to the graph, reducing the time to find the legend.
>> 3. Some graphs do not have a title.
>> 4. Pink is not clear for people to read.
>> 5. The label for the items are too small to read.
>> 6. For the tree chart, there are too many colors.
>> 7. To compare two tree charts, the author can use color to identify the rank.
>> 8. There is too much information on a single body photo. Removing the information from the description will make the page much clear. Moreover, the page uses not only colors but also font size to highlight the point, which is redundancy.
> - Critique 2:
>> Which is cool and attractive to use different animations and visualizations to desplay the data. But if the following issues can be fixed, then the page would be great. 
>> 1. Putting some summary beside each graph can help readers get the point.
>> 2. The photo also should come up with some words to elaborate on the situation.
>> 3. All the other data are based on the "world" field, only a chart based on country, making it not consistency.
>> 4. Some font sizes are too small.
> - Critique 3:
>> Overall, the page is good. I cannot find anything needed to be modified as the first glance. But I think it would be better if the following items can be improved will be great.
>> 1. The color tone should be the same, or it seems like made by different people.
>> 2. The photo should use the text to elaborate.
> 5. Plan on change
>> - Modify the color to same tone.
>> - Add more elaborate on each graph and photo.
>> - Change the line graph to animated one.
>> - Add the title.
>> - In tree chart, combine small items to Others and use the color to rank the category.
>> - Remove the text in the background and move the description to the text field.
