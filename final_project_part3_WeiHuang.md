#### Modification for Skretch
> After listening to critiques from others, the following are the modifications that I have done: 
> 1. Change the static line chart to activate the line chart to highlight the difference between years.
> 2. Add a title for all the charts.
> 3. Add an explanation for all the decorated photos.
> 4. Change unclear colors, such as pink to orange.
> 5. Used a circle for the tree chart and colored the items by the values.
> 6. Remove the detail from the photo of the organ body and put the detail on each scroll point.
> 7. Use the same range of data in the report.
> 8. Make the font size bigger enough to read.
> 9. Use the same color tone for the report.
