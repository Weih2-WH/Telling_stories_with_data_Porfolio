> For the third graph, I added the title for the graph, allowing people to know the idea that the graph would like to present at the first sight. Second, I used the filters allowing users can focus on what they are concerned about, the country or the year. Moreover, by selecting the countries, the reader can compare the Debt-to-GDP ratio difference between the countries they chose.
> Comparing the three graphs, the first only focus on a year and the difference between all the countries. The second graph shows the trend for each country. The third one, I do some data filter to only show the trend for Asia-Pacific and USA. With less data, readers can take attention on much specific countries.
