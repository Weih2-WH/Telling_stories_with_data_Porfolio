> First, I added the title for the graph, allowing people to know the idea that the graph would like to present at the first sight. Second, I used the filters allowing users can focus on what they are concerned about, the country or the year. Moreover, by selecting the countries, the reader can compare the Debt-to-GDP ratio difference between the countries they chose.
> For the default graph, I would like readers to focus on LTU, GBR, USA, and GRC. So I only provide these four lines. Moreover, I would like to get readers' attention to the difference each year. So I use the dark colors for the specific year and let the year-trend to light colors.
