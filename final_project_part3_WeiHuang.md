## Part3
#### Modification for Skretch
> After listening to critiques from others, the following are the modifications that I have done: 
> 1. Change the static line chart to activate the line chart to highlight the difference between years.
> 2. Add a title for all the charts.
> 3. Add an explanation for all the decorated photos.
> 4. Change unclear colors, such as pink to orange.
> 5. Used a circle for the tree chart and colored the items by the values.
> 6. Remove the detail from the photo of the organ body and put the detail on each scroll point.
> 7. Use the same range of data in the report.
> 8. Make the font size bigger enough to read.
> 9. Use the same color tone for the report.

#### Final Report
[Cancer & Environment](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/cancer-environment/index.html  "Title") 

#### Description for each page
1.	Today I would like to use this minute to awareness of the environmental impact on death, especially on cancer.
2.	In the graph, we can see that the death rate for all humans decreases. But the percentage of people dying because of cancer is increasing.
3.	Death is the lesson all of us need to face. Some people pass in peace some pass in ill. How can we prevent illnesses? First, let us look at what are the reasons that caused the death.
4.	On the graph, we can see that almost half of the death reasons during these two decades are all ills. Especially, cardiovascular the ill that happened relative to the heart and blood vessels. The second one is the target for todayâ€™s topic, Neoplasms aka cancer.
5.	Even if cancer is the second highest reason that caused death, some reports also point out that 40% of cancer patients are died because of cardiovascular. Thus, somehow cancer should be the priority reason for death.
Second, there are many arguments that cancer is caused by genes or the environment.
Thus, I would like to find out more data to find out whether a human can prevent cancer or not.
6.	So many Illnesses are the main enemy of humans. But why I would like to focus on cancer?
7.	First, with the age group, we can figure out which group will be the main target for cancer.
Based on world data, we can see that ages older than 50 are the main target for cancer. Based on the different incomes, the target age will be younger when the income is low.
8.	Then, based on 2000 data separated by gender, men have a higher probability to get cancer than women. Moreover, men have a higher probability that will die after getting cancer, than women. Additionally, under the world data, the death rate for cancer is half of the number who get cancer.
9.	With the above information, we can summarize that elder men are the main target for cancer issues than other groups. As we know that cancer is our big enemy for us, how can we prevent it? Or is cancer can be prevented?
10.	On the graph, we can see that the possibility of most cancer caused by acquired factors is lower than 40%. But what about the percentage the people who get each kind of cancer?
11.	For men, lung, prostate, stomach, colorectal, and liver have a higher possibility to have cancer.
12.	For women, breast, lung, colorectal, cervix uteri, and thyroid have a higher possibility to have cancer.
13.	Here I provide the detail of the acquired factors for each top 5 cancer type for each gender. Please take some time to read them and prevent these  factors in the future, which will prevent you from getting cancer.
What is the percentage of incidence rates for the top 5 cancer types for women?
How the percentage that the top 5 cancer caused by the environment?
How can we prevent cancer?
Let us introduce more detail from the top of the body.
14.	In conclusion, most cancer happens in late adulthood. However, the impact factors accumulate at young ages. Additionally, more than half of cancer happens because of acquired factors. Thus, by avoiding the acquired factors we can prevent cancer happened.
